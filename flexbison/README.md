# ðŸš§ WIP

Flex++/Bison versions of the grammar. Based on my earlier https://github.com/kfsone/flub

I also spent way too much time shaping the yy/ll files and writing C++ code into them, so I
intentionally derailed myself and tried to create a minimum, naive version that would just
parse without worrying about AST construction for the moment. See [naive/](naive/).
