2024-03-25 Current focus is a basic C++ implementation and creation of sample files for it to
           work against, which can then be the basis for others. The first pass will be a naive
           implementation without any particular effort at niceties like location tracking or
           performance. See [naive\_cpp](naive_cpp/).
